# population genetics analysis

Code for running PSMC/MSMC on physically phased genomes and assess how phasing accuracy affect split time estimations.

Also include code for running Approxmiate Bayesian Computation following PSMC to estimate split time and migration rate.

Analysis are involved in `Song S, Sliwerska E, Emery S, Kidd JM. Modeling human population separation history using physically phased genomes. Genetics. 2017 Jan 1;205(1):385-95.`
